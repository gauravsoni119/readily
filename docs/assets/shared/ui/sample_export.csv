Anyone who really cares about network level optimization should read this book. I never thought about the use cases that can harm the mobile users. But with this book one can clearly understand why we should care about the mobile devices in terms of bandwidth. It has great explanation about HTTP 2 which will optimize the application to another level. The examples mentioned in the books are also great. Examples are from real life applications such as how facebook handle chat messaging, how google Hangouts use webRTC etc. I really enjoyed by reading this book",,,1,,,0,,,,,
